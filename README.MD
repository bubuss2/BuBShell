# BuBShell
BuBShell is simple shell for unix(POSIX) based systems.  
I made this project to learn internals of linux shells, and expand my skills in Go language.

## Usage
Enter into the main folder of this project (where are the .go files are located).  
And type command.
```
go build
```
an executable should've been created.  
Then run the executable, for example:
```
./BuBShell
```

The shell should have started. And You should see current working directory, and > symbol.
```
/home/user > 
```

To exit from shell type:
```
exit
```

## Requirements

Go - 1.13.8+  
Linux
  
### Note
This project is still in development. I plan to add support for more commands and features.
